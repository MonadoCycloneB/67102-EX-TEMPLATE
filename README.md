# Template for Intro2CS Exercise

## Key Goals:

- Quick-start projects
- Easy and Fast Zipping of project files
- Pre-made folder and file structure

## Overview

The template consists of three folders:

- **src** - Place your exercise files here.
- **tests** - A place for all code tests to live happily.
- **utils** - Anything that does not belong in the previous two folders.

Inside the util folder there is a template python file which contains the necessary details for submissions. Copy and rename when creating new project files.

## Building a Submission Zip
Before running the zip.py script first time, make sure you change the ZIP_NAME variable to match with the required name.

After that, simply run the script to create a zip file of all the files in the 'src' folder.
